# DeepLearning4All

Colection of deep learning colab notebooks to be used as working examples for different tasks. 


* Image classification
* Image segmentation
* Image registeration 
* Object recognition
* Object detection
* CyclicGAN
  - Image to Image
  - Image enhancement
  - Image segmentation
  - Object detection 
  

I will try to:

- provide two popular implementation Pytorch and Tensorflow.  
- provide 2D and 3D examples.
- links to useful resources.
